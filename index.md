## 🎯 Key Engineering Takeaways Overview

1. **Proposed Solution vs. True Requirement:** A client request like *"Build a chatbot"* is a proposed solution. FDEs discover the underlying business requirement (*"Reduce resolution time safely"*).
2. **LLMs Are Reasoning Engines, Not Applications:** An LLM alone cannot run business transactions or verify facts; production systems require RAG knowledge retrieval, business APIs, RBAC authorization, guardrails, and human oversight.
3. **The Attention Paradigm Shift:** Attention connects any two tokens across a sequence in $O(1)$ matrix operations, enabling massive GPU training parallelization and eliminating the sequential context bottleneck of RNNs.
